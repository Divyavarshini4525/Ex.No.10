## Date:13/11/25
## Reg. No.21222205012

## Aim:
To demonstrate how various prompting techniques (query decomposition, decision-making, semantic filtering, etc.) can be employed to create content such as reports, articles, case studies, or creative works like comic books, using ChatGPT or similar models. The objective is to highlight how different prompt structures affect the content's quality, coherence, and structure.

## Procedure:
1.	Introduction to Prompt Patterns: Begin by understanding the following prompt patterns:

○	Query Decomposition: Breaking down complex queries into smaller, actionable parts.

○	Decision Making: Asking the model to choose between options or directions.

○	Answer Engineering: Refining outputs by giving detailed instructions on how to structure or format the answer.

○	Fact Check List: Ensuring the content is factually accurate, especially for reports or case studies.

○	Tail Generation: Extending the content logically to create depth in storytelling or analysis.

○	Menu Actions: Presenting multiple action choices and guiding the AI to select one.

○	Semantic Filter: Applying filters to control the tone, style, and accuracy of the content.

2.	Choosing the Content Type: Decide on the type of content you want to create. This could be:

○	Reports (e.g., industry analysis, sustainability reports, etc.)

○	Case Studies (e.g., business solutions, technological innovations)

○	Articles (e.g., opinion pieces, educational articles)

○	Creative Content (e.g., comic book story, short stories, video scripts)

3.	For example, you could choose a business report on market trends, a case study on a successful startup, or even a story-based prompt like creating a fictional world for a comic.

4.	Creating the Prompts:

○	Start with simple prompts to generate initial content.

○	Gradually refine the prompts, moving toward more complex techniques like decision-making (asking the model to pick one of several options), tail generation (extending the narrative), and semantic filtering 
(adjusting style or tone).
5.	Generating and Refining Outputs: Use the model to generate initial drafts, and then refine the outputs using iterative adjustments:

○	For a report, prompt the model with basic data, then ask for a deeper analysis and insights.

○	For creative content, refine the initial story idea with specific details on characters, settings, or actions.

6.	Review and Evaluation: After generating content, evaluate the outputs for:

○	Coherence: Is the generated content logical and structured?

○	Creativity/Originality: Is the content engaging and fresh?

○	Accuracy: Is the content factually accurate (for reports and case studies)?

○	Tone and Style: Does the content match the intended tone (formal, creative, educational)?

## Aim:

To demonstrate how various prompting techniques (query decomposition, decision-making, semantic filtering, etc.) can be employed to create content such as reports, articles, case studies, or creative works like comic books, using ChatGPT or similar models. The objective is to highlight how different prompt structures affect the content’s quality, coherence, and structure.

## Apparatus / Tools Required:

1. Computer system or laptop

2. Internet connectivity

3. ChatGPT or any AI-based content generation model

4. Word processing software (MS Word/Google Docs)

## Theory:

Prompt engineering is the technique of crafting effective instructions or “prompts” to guide AI models like ChatGPT in generating desired content. Different prompting methods influence how the model interprets a task, structures information, and expresses creativity or factual accuracy.

Common Prompting Techniques include:

**1. Query Decomposition:**

Breaking a complex query into smaller, more specific parts to generate structured and coherent responses.

**2.Decision-Making Prompts:**

Asking the AI to select between multiple options or paths to direct the output flow.

**3. Answer Engineering:**

Structuring prompts with instructions about format, tone, or organization to refine the answer.

**4. Fact Check List:**

Requesting verified or cited facts to maintain content reliability in reports and research.

**5. Tail Generation:**

Extending or concluding existing content logically to add depth or continuity.

**6. Menu Actions:**

Presenting multiple action choices (e.g., write, summarize, or compare) and allowing the AI to choose.

**7. Semantic Filtering:**

Applying filters to control tone, accuracy, or style (e.g., formal, persuasive, creative).

These techniques help improve the quality, coherence, and creativity of AI-generated outputs.

## Procedure:

**Introduction to Prompt Patterns:**

Study different prompt techniques and understand their applications in content generation.

**Selecting Content Type:**

Choose a type of content (e.g., report, case study, article, or creative writing).

**Creating Basic Prompts:**

Start with simple prompts such as “Write a short article on renewable energy.”

**Refining Prompts Using Techniques:**

    --> Apply Query Decomposition to break the topic into sections (introduction, advantages, challenges).

    --> Use Decision-Making Prompts to make the AI choose between subtopics.

    --> Use Semantic Filtering to set tone (e.g., formal report, educational tone).

**Generating and Refining Outputs:**

    --> Generate initial drafts using simple prompts.

    --> Apply refined prompts to enhance structure, coherence, and accuracy.

    --> Compare results from different prompting techniques.

**Review and Evaluation:**

Evaluate each version based on:

    --> Clarity and structure

    --> Factual accuracy

    --> Creativity and tone

    --> Relevance to the topic

## Test Case Scenarios (Any Two):

## 1. Educational Report on Renewable Energy

**Basic Prompt:**

“Write a short report on renewable energy.”

**Refined Prompt (using Query Decomposition + Semantic Filtering):**

“Create a detailed educational report on renewable energy sources. Include introduction, types (solar, wind, hydro, biomass), importance in sustainable development, and future prospects. Use a formal and informative tone suitable for academic readers.”

**Output Summary:**

    --> The refined prompt generated a structured, section-wise report with improved coherence and educational tone.

    --> The content emphasized sustainability, technical details, and environmental impact.

## 2. Case Study on Business Success

**Basic Prompt:**

“Write a case study on a successful business.”

**Refined Prompt (using Decision-Making + Tail Generation):**

“Develop a detailed case study on Tesla Inc. highlighting its innovation strategy, electric vehicle market leadership, and sustainable business model. Include introduction, challenges, strategic decisions, outcomes, and lessons learned. Conclude with how these strategies can inspire startups.”

**Output Summary:**

    --> The refined prompt produced an analytical case study with clear sections.

    --> It incorporated decision-based reasoning (business challenges and solutions).

    --> Tail generation improved the conclusion’s depth and continuity.

## Result / Observation:

1. Simple prompts provided general and unstructured outputs.

2. Applying advanced prompt techniques produced well-organized, coherent, and factual content.

3. Semantic filtering improved tone and readability.

4. Query decomposition ensured clarity and logical flow.

5. Tail generation extended and concluded content effectively.

## Sample Outputs (Illustrative Comparison):

| **Prompt Type**     | **Example Prompt**                                             | **Result Summary**                  |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Basic Prompt        | “Write about renewable energy.”                                | Gave a short, generic paragraph.    |
| Query Decomposition | “Explain renewable energy: introduction, types, and benefits.” | Produced structured sections.       |
| Semantic Filtering  | “Write an educational, formal report on renewable energy.”     | Improved tone and academic quality. |
| Tail Generation     | “Extend the report with a conclusion about future prospects.”  | Added depth and completeness.       |

## Result:

The experiment successfully demonstrated how structured prompting techniques can enhance AI-generated content. Different prompt patterns significantly influence content structure, tone, and coherence.


## Conclusion:

By applying various prompting techniques, you can generate high-quality content for a wide range of use cases, from business reports and case studies to creative works like short stories and articles. This experiment demonstrates how structured prompting can guide AI models like ChatGPT to create coherent, accurate, and engaging outputs tailored to specific needs.
